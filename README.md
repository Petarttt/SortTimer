# SortTimer
A program that compares sorting algorithms by speed.

This program can generate an array of random numbers from 0 to user input with an array size of user input and sort the array with different algorithms:
-Bubble Sort
-Selection Sort
-Insertion Sort
-Quick Sort
-Radix Sort 
-Merge Sort
It mesures time taken to sort the array for each algorithm and prints it out.
Time is mesured with precison up to a microsecond using "gettimeofday();".
